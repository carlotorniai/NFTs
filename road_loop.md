## Road Loop


### Background
This is my second NFT created on January 8th 2022. It is a processing of an original pic taken in Tuscany on Jan 8th 2022.
I wanted to generate an animation and I wanted to do it programmatically.
I used Tensorflow with a set of style to create the images for the animation. Styles were from Congdom, Matisse and Monet paintings.
