## Lezzeno Dreams


### Background
This is my first NFT created on December 28th 2021. It is an editing of an original pic I took from Filario hotel's shore on Lake Como on July 17 2021.
I like this pic to be the first of my NFTs becasue it is a very peaceful moment in a very troubled year. 

In my editing of the original pic I wanted to convey the sense of be sucked in the beauty and tranquillity of the scenery that almost kidnapps you brining you into a different dimension.
